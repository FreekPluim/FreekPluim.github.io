                                    <p>This is the first ever gamejam i participated in but it will cerainly not be the last. In this gamejam i focused primaraly on the Enemy AI. Creating the behaviour of the Enemy. With the crab just bouncing around the room randomly. The squid chasing the player. The clamp being a sort of turret that shoots pearls and the clishab (ClampFishCrab) leaching onto a wall, aims at the player and shoots itself straight towards the player with a good amount of speed.</p>

                                    <p>This gamejam i focused primaraly on overall gameplay programming. The aim of the game is to with 2 players go thru each level where one player can not touch the light and the other can not touch the dark. You both need to reach the door to go to the next level.</p>
