                    <p>My name is Freek Pluim, i'm 21 years guy from the Netherlands. I study at Saxion School for Applied Science in the study Creative Media and Game Technology (CMGT). My main drive is to become a Game Developer.</p>

                    <p>From 2015 untill 2020 i followed a study at Aventus in Deventer. From this i have a degree in Secondary vocational education level 4 ICT. In this study i also realised that i really like the activity of programming. Going from this i started looking for another study that i could do after i got my degree, ending up at Saxion.</p>
                    
                    <p>In this study i have been trying to figure out what my interests are in the game development scene. I have noticed an interest in Enemy AI. This was also what i mainly focused on in the Global GameJam 2021.</p>
                    
                    <p>At the moment i am living at home together with my parents and my brother altough im searching for a place to live in Enschede with 2 of my friends from the same study.</p>
                    
                    <p>In my free time i mostly watch series, scroll the internet, work on school or personal projects. I also play volleybal about 2x a week and i train for survival runs.</p>
